Vision OS version for microcontroller platforms based on Arduino.

As of now, Vision OS will support the Arduino MEGA boards based on the Atmel ATmega2560 AVR. Hence, it is currently limited to the 8-bit architecture, although we are looking to expand to other boards in the near future.

At the present stage, Vision OS for MCU's is still in it's infancy and can perform very basic operations in real time. This project is meant to be entirely open-source and is aimed at creating an eco-system of Vision OS powered IoT devices. This also means that during development, special emphasis is to be given to issues such as security, privacy, user-experience and versatility, as this is the core design philosophy of Vision OS.

Development is currently undergoing in the following areas:
1.  I/O management
2.  Interrupt services
3.  Communication services
4.  Device detection and driver activation
5.  Memory management
6.  Power management for connected devices
7.  Process management
8.  Timers and time management
9.  Protection and security
10. File handling
11. Console interaction
12. Graphics capabilities
12. App system

All of the above features are being implemented as system calls and background services.
